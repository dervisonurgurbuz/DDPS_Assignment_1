# DDPS_Assignment_1


PageRank is an iterative machine learning algorithm which is going to implement on Spark. The performances of ‘Ba- sic spark’, ‘Spark + controlled partitioning’ and Hadoop in terms of iteration times were compared during this experi- ment. All three system had to run 10 iterations of PageRank on a 54 GB Wikipedia dump to process a link graph of ≈ 4 million articles. The experiments were performed twice, once using 30 nodes per system and once using 60 nodes per system.
